Problem: How to add items to spinners
Steps Taken: used https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html
and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5241660/how-can-i-add-items-to-a-spinner-in-android
Solution: Cannot set on click listener for spinners. Instead, I created an ArrayAdapter<String>
and used this adapter for each of the three spinners.
