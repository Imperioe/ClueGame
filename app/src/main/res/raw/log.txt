Professor Vegdahl's TTTgame was referenced a number of times.

Problem:
    We need a way to randomize the order of Card objects in an arrayList to shuffle the deck.
Steps Taken:
    I looked at a post on StackOverflow by user NINCOMPOOP that suggested using
    Collections.shuffle(ArrayList).  It remains to be seen if it wil be useful.

Solution:
    It compiles so it might actually work.
